/** This module provides an implementation for Silent Payments, as specified in
 *  BIP352. This particularly involves the creation of input tweak data by
 *  summing up secret or public keys and the derivation of a shared secret using
 *  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. Combined are either:
 *    - spender's secret keys and recipient's public key (a * B, sender side)
 *    - spender's public keys and recipient's secret key (A * b, recipient side)
 *  With this result, the necessary key material for ultimately creating/scanning
 *  or spending Silent Payment outputs can be determined.
 *
 *  Note that this module is _not_ a full implementation of BIP352, as it
 *  inherently doesn't deal with higher-level concepts like addresses, output
 *  script types or transactions. The intent is to provide a module for
 *  abstracting away the elliptic-curve operations required for the protocol. For
 *  any wallet software already using libsecp256k1, this API should provide all
 *  the functions needed for a Silent Payments implementation without requiring
 *  any further elliptic-curve operations from the wallet.

/** This struct serves as an input parameter for passing the silent payment
 *  address data.
 *
 *  The index field is for when more than one address is being sent to in
 *  a transaction. Index is set based on the original ordering of the addresses
 *  and used to return the generated outputs matching the original ordering.
 *  When more than one recipient is used, the recipient array will be sorted in
 *  place as part of generating the outputs, but the generated outputs will be
 *  returned in the original ordering specified by the index to ensure the
 *  caller is able to match up the generated outputs to the correct silent
 *  payment address (e.g., to be able to assign the correct amounts to the
 *  correct generated outputs in the final transaction).

/** Create Silent Payment outputs for recipient(s).
 *
 *  Given a list of n secret keys a_1...a_n (one for each silent payment
 *  eligible input to spend), a serialized outpoint, and a list of recipients,
 *  create the taproot outputs.
 *
 *  `outpoint_smallest` refers to the smallest outpoint lexicographically
 *  from the transaction inputs (both silent payments eligible and non-eligible
 *  inputs). This value MUST be the smallest outpoint out of all of the
 *  transaction inputs, otherwise the recipient will be unable to find the
 *  payment. Determining the smallest outpoint from the list of transaction
 *  inputs is the responsibility of the caller. It is strongly recommended
 *  that implementations ensure they are doing this correctly by using the
 *  test vectors from BIP352.
 *
 *  If necessary, the secret keys are negated to enforce the right y-parity.
 *  For that reason, the secret keys have to be passed in via two different
 *  parameter pairs, depending on whether the seckeys correspond to x-only
 *  outputs or not.
 *
 *  Returns: 1 if creation of outputs was successful. 0 if an error occured.
 *  Args:                ctx: pointer to a context object
 *  Out:   generated_outputs: pointer to an array of pointers to xonly pubkeys,
 *                            one per recipient.
 *                            The outputs here are sorted by the index value
 *                            provided in the recipient objects.
 *  In:           recipients: pointer to an array of pointers to silent payment
 *                            recipients, where each recipient is a scan public
 *                            key, a spend public key, and an index indicating
 *                            its position in the original ordering. The
 *                            recipient array will be sorted in place, but
 *                            generated outputs are saved in the
 *                            `generated_outputs` array to match the ordering
 *                            from the index field. This ensures the caller is
 *                            able to match the generated outputs to the
 *                            correct silent payment addresses. The same
 *                            recipient can be passed multiple times to create
