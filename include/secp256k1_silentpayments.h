/** This module provides an implementation for Silent Payments, as specified in
 *  BIP352. This particularly involves the creation of input tweak data by
 *  summing up secret or public keys and the derivation of a shared secret using
 *  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. Combined are either:
 *    - spender's secret keys and recipient's public key (a * B, sender side)
 *    - spender's public keys and recipient's secret key (A * b, recipient side)
 *  With this result, the necessary key material for ultimately creating/scanning
 *  or spending Silent Payment outputs can be determined.
 *
 *  Note that this module is _not_ a full implementation of BIP352, as it
 *  inherently doesn't deal with higher-level concepts like addresses, output
 *  script types or transactions. The intent is to provide a module for
 *  abstracting away the elliptic-curve operations required for the protocol. For
 *  any wallet software already using libsecp256k1, this API should provide all
 *  the functions needed for a Silent Payments implementation without requiring
 *  any further elliptic-curve operations from the wallet.
